# Asteroids-Game-with-Neural-Networks
I designed a ship to play the game asteroids to compete in a class competition. The ship was used by the asteroids game framework built by my professor, (from which I will not be including, for it is a reused bi-annual assignment). I will provide my implementation for the ship I designed using a fully connected neural network and the genetic algorithm that I used to find an optimal ship to use in the competition.
